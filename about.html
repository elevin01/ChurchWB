                    We believe that following Jesus makes life better for you, your family, and our

                      aim is to create a safe place for everyone to be all that God has intended them to

                  <p class="news-dek">
                    Our mission is to go and make disciples in a one mile radius of our church and reach
                    the entire city. We believe real transformation happens when we stay close, show up
                    consistently, and invite people into a life with Jesus.

                   <p>
                    That means we focus on the people we can know personally—those we can serve, pray with, and walk
                    alongside week after week. We listen first, share life together, and trust God to multiply what is
                    faithful and small.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our vision is simple: stronger families, deeper friendships, and neighbors who feel like family.
                    We want homes to be healthier, relationships to be restored, and community to be a place where people
                    are known, supported, and encouraged to grow.

                      You are searching for a church to call home. A place filled with real, compassionate
                      people who welcome you with open arms. A place where your kids look forward to
                      going, and you do too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      International Gospel Church New York City is such a place. Here you will find the connection,
                      community, and comfort you crave. We know how difficult it can be to find a home
                      church that lovingly leads you closer to Jesus, so we keep a simple, real-life
                      approach to all things church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We focus on sharing biblical truth, participating in daily discipleship, modeling
                      obedience, engaging in meaningful gatherings, and serving generously. We aim to be
                      humble and real: we want something for you, not from you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Life without a strong church community can feel lonely, chaotic, and empty. We want
                      more for you than that. Together, we can build stronger families, healthier
                      relationships, and happier lives while stepping into the fullness of all God
                      designed us to be. At International Gospel Church New York City, community means family.
