                    We believe that following Jesus makes life better for you, your family, and our

                    <p>
                      You are searching for a church to call home. A place filled with real, compassionate
                      people who welcome you with open arms. A place where your kids look forward to
                      going, and you do too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Bronx Community Church is such a place. Here you will find the connection,
                      community, and comfort you crave. We know how difficult it can be to find a home
                      church that lovingly leads you closer to Jesus, so we keep a simple, real-life
                      approach to all things church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We focus on sharing biblical truth, participating in daily discipleship, modeling
                      obedience, engaging in meaningful gatherings, and serving generously. We aim to be
                      humble and real: we want something for you, not from you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Life without a strong church community can feel lonely, chaotic, and empty. We want
                      more for you than that. Together, we can build stronger families, healthier
                      relationships, and happier lives while stepping into the fullness of all God
                      designed us to be. At Bronx Community Church, community means family.
